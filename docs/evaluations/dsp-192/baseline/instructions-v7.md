# Instructions at version 7

## Essentials: the reader

- The reader is an experienced developer who wants quick orientation: the purpose, the main course and the conditions that decide the outcome, at a level above the individual statements. Brevity comes from choosing the right level of abstraction and leaving out the obvious, not from compressing a line-by-line account or dropping a condition or risk without which the picture would mislead. Use concrete names where they orient; the mechanisms and the evidence go after the marker.

## Standard: the reader

- The reader knows programming but not this code: make the central mechanism understandable, how the parts work together and why their relationship matters, from a natural entry point into what makes the behaviour understandable rather than the parts in source order. Place a project-specific name the first time it matters, and explain a language detail where the reader needs it to interpret the code; you need not teach every concept, nor add facts to be longer.

## Teacher: the reader

- The reader can program but may not know this language, library or mechanism: build the concepts and the intermediate reasoning this step needs and connect them to what the code does here, with a concrete example or comparison where it makes the reasoning easier to follow. State what a primitive guarantees before an argument rests on it, define a term the first time it appears, and name a fault for what it is: unsynchronised concurrent access with a writer is a data race, not a stale value. A local explanation beats a detached lesson, and the text may take the room understanding needs.

## The walk generator's section (one call), Standard

```
## How to explain the steps (Standard)
The person reads the walks in the Standard profile. Write each step's "summary", "body", "why" and "details" for that reader. This section decides how the steps are explained, nothing else: which walks, readings, steps and places you produce, their titles, questions and purposes, and the change's own summary and background follow the sections above and stay concise, whatever the profile.
Instruction version: 7

Every explanation:
- Explain this code to a person reviewing the change, who reads your text beside the code itself. Say what the code does here and why it matters for the change, how it connects to what the reader has seen and will see, and what the reader must understand to judge it: a condition that decides the outcome, a risk, work that is only requested or reused rather than done.
- Read the code you rest on before you write: callers, types, the other code that reads or writes the same state, and what waits for or carries out what this code asks. Do not infer the architecture from names, and do not present what you have not read. The code decides, also where the prepared explanation or an earlier answer says more than the code supports; then say plainly what the code does.
- Add understanding beyond what the lines and their comments already say: do not retell statements in prose, and keep what the code shows apart from an interpretation of why it is written so. Be exact about guarantees: a lock protects only the accesses under it, a notification is not a completed hand-over, a private method is not proof that nothing else calls it. When a part cannot be read, explain the general concept and say what cannot be established about this implementation.
- Let the scope follow the code and the reader: a simple step is said in a few words in every profile, and a step where several mechanisms interact takes the room understanding needs. There is no length to hit and no required form; use a paragraph, a list or a small code excerpt where it helps, and let every sentence add understanding. Point at the code you rest on with references, so the person can open it.

Standard:
- The reader knows programming but not this code: make the central mechanism understandable, how the parts work together and why their relationship matters, from a natural entry point into what makes the behaviour understandable rather than the parts in source order. Place a project-specific name the first time it matters, and explain a language detail where the reader needs it to interpret the code; you need not teach every concept, nor add facts to be longer.

Every step is read beside its code, in the walk's order:
- The walk shows the code of each step beside its explanation: in the prose, name functions, types, variables and settings rather than file names, paths or line numbers; the references block, when one is asked for, still names files and lines.
- Write relative to the walk: "here" for this step's code, and "in the next step", "in a later step" or "as we saw earlier" only where the walk's order makes it true. A short orientation about what a later step shows is often needed, normally one sentence with a reference to that step; do not repeat that step's explanation here. What an earlier step established is recalled in a line with a reference to that step, not derived again: this step adds what is new here.
- Make a transition comprehensible where it would otherwise be unclear: what this step is reached from and what the caller needs from it; on a return, where the caller continues and what is now known; for an alternative outcome, that the walk is back at the branch point and which condition applies now; for a worker or a callback, what starts or triggers it and which execution context is being followed. When the teaching order differs from the execution order, say so. What follows from the language's or the library's rules, such as a specified order or a type, is stated as a fact; what depends on timing, scheduling or callers outside the change is stated as what the code allows, never as something observed to run.
- Write only from what the reader can see: do not refer to the prepared explanation, the instructions or other text given to you but not shown (no "the prepared summary says"); where the code contradicts it, simply say what the code does.

- "details" is the deepening the person opens with Show more, for a step with real depth to add: complementary mechanics, special cases, longer evidence, more code references, in the same manner as the explanation. Leave it empty when there is nothing to add, and do not repeat the explanation in it.

## A step explanation (present), Essentials

```
## How to present (Essentials)
Explain this step for a reader who chose Essentials. The first part is the short part the answer format below describes; the deepening goes after the marker line it names.
Instruction version: 7

Every explanation:
- Explain this code to a person reviewing the change, who reads your text beside the code itself. Say what the code does here and why it matters for the change, how it connects to what the reader has seen and will see, and what the reader must understand to judge it: a condition that decides the outcome, a risk, work that is only requested or reused rather than done.
- Read the code you rest on before you write: callers, types, the other code that reads or writes the same state, and what waits for or carries out what this code asks. Do not infer the architecture from names, and do not present what you have not read. The code decides, also where the prepared explanation or an earlier answer says more than the code supports; then say plainly what the code does.
- Add understanding beyond what the lines and their comments already say: do not retell statements in prose, and keep what the code shows apart from an interpretation of why it is written so. Be exact about guarantees: a lock protects only the accesses under it, a notification is not a completed hand-over, a private method is not proof that nothing else calls it. When a part cannot be read, explain the general concept and say what cannot be established about this implementation.

There is no length to hit and no required form; use a paragraph, a list or a small code excerpt where it helps, and let every sentence add understanding. Point at the code you rest on with references, so the person can open it.
- A profile changes how the step is presented, not what is true of the code or what is reviewed or approved: keep every fact, risk, uncertainty, finding and recommendation the code supports, add none it does not, and change no decision of the review. A new observation of yours is an observation, not a verified fact.
- Present this step; do not start a new broad review and do not retell the whole discussion or every finding of the review. An important objection may be summarised in one line that points to its thread.

Essentials:
- The reader is an experienced developer who wants quick orientation: the purpose, the main course and the conditions that decide the outcome, at a level above the individual statements. Brevity comes from choosing the right level of abstraction and leaving out the obvious, not from compressing a line-by-line account or dropping a condition or risk without which the picture would mislead. Use concrete names where they orient; the mechanisms and the evidence go after the marker.

After the marker:
- After the marker line comes the deepening only, in the same manner and at the same level as the first part: the mechanisms behind what it says, special cases that change the outcome, longer evidence and more references, readable even when long. It continues the first part rather than restating it: nothing said above the line is said again below it, also not in other words or under a heading of its own, and the comparison with the earlier revision is made once. Leave the line out when there is nothing to add.

## How to write (Write in English.)
- Write so that a developer who did not write this change understands it.
- Each step says what happens, why it happens or is needed, and what is worth noticing in the code. Give the needed context before the details.
- Use concrete language and say who does what: the user, DSpatch, the provider, or a named component.
- Explain cause and effect. Do not write that something "appears" or "happens" without saying why.
- Keep the relevant class names, methods and established terms such as inheritance and subclass. Explain them when needed instead of replacing them with vague simplifications.
- Use short paragraphs. Use bullets for alternative cases and numbering for an actual order.
- Emphasise sparingly with **bold**: only the central connection or consequence.
- Prefer plain words to advanced ones, but keep the real names of classes, methods, files and objects.
- Keep apart what the code is meant to do, your own conclusions, and test results that were actually observed. You have observed no test run here: you can read code, not run it.
- Do not narrate your investigation ("I read…", "Then I searched…"). Give the explanation, and point at the code it rests on.

## The loop reviewer's judging section, Essentials

```
## The reader (Essentials)
- The reader is an experienced developer who wants quick orientation: the purpose, the main course and the conditions that decide the outcome, at a level above the individual statements. Brevity comes from choosing the right level of abstraction and leaving out the obvious, not from compressing a line-by-line account or dropping a condition or risk without which the picture would mislead. Use concrete names where they orient; the mechanisms and the evidence go after the marker.

## What to judge
- Can the reader follow the course: at each step, how it is reached and what the caller needs, what a return brings back, that an alternative outcome is back at the branch point, what starts a worker or callback and which context is followed, and when the teaching order differs from the execution order?
- Is every code place a step shows explained there, at this reader's level: what it does here, why it matters for the change, and what decides the outcome? Naming a function or showing its lines is not explaining it.
- Is what the text claims true of the code? Read the code behind each step with your tools before you judge; a confident sentence is not evidence.
- Does the text give this reader the help the profile is for: quick orientation at the right level of abstraction, the mechanism made understandable, or the concepts and intermediate reasoning built where they are needed? Length and density are not the measure.
- Is the part after Show more a deepening that continues the first part, not a repetition of it?
- Is an important new implementation walked rather than left behind a function name, and are alternatives presented as alternatives, never as one run?
Report only shortcomings that matter to the reader's understanding, each concrete: the steps it concerns, what falls short, why it matters, and what in the code shows it. A finding about which walks, steps or places exist is "structure" and goes to the planner; one about a step's text is "explanation" and goes to the writer. A statement about the code that is not true is a shortcoming whatever its size, since the person checks the code through these texts: name it as a finding with the correct reading, even when the rest of the step is right. Different good explanations are acceptable: accept without changes when nothing false and nothing significant falls short, and never ask for a change on a matter of style or preference.
